### #Cubli: An in-depth study of an open source project

The name "[Cubli](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-dandrea/research-projects/archive/cubli.html)" comes from a project with the same name at ETH Zurich, aimed at achieving controlled jumping, balancing, and controlled descent of a cube.

â€‹	Developer ZhaJiHu simplified it into a smaller cube "[Cubli-Mini](https://github.com/ZhaJiHu/Cubli_Mini)" without an active braking system, requiring manual adjustment to near the balance point to achieve edge and point balancing. Additionally, this simplified project is fully open-sourced from software to hardware on GitHub, adhering to the GPL-3.0 license.

-------

This project is based on the latter, aiming to replicate this simplified version of Cubli. Throughout the process, we will delve deeply into learning about the hardware and software aspects of the project, including basic control principle, PCB design and analysis, soldering techniques, as well as the FreeRTOS of the microprocessor and various communication protocols for the software part.
