<ul>
<li><p>System State Variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cube Angle: <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Cube Angular Velocity: <span class="math inline">\(\theta&#39;\)</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>System Control Variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Momentum Wheel Angular Velocity: <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The IMU's X-axis, the momentum wheel's axis of rotation, and the balancing edge are all in the same plane. As a result: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{l}
        \ \theta = angle_x - angle_e  \\[1ex]
        \ \theta&#39; = gyro_x \\[1ex]
        \ \omega&#39; = motorspeed_x \\[1ex]
    \end{array}
    \right.
\end{align*}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    \Rightarrow \quad Lqr = (angle_x - angle_e) \times  k_p + gyro_x \times k_v + motorspeed_x \times k_s
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>

<h2 id="corner-balance">#Corner Balance</h2>
<p>The basic principle is to add control of the Y-axis to unilateral balance.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Control-Theory/Corner.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" align=center/></p>
<p>Assuming the current posture is a point balance. Establish a coordinate system based on the three-axis direction of the IMU, with the origin coinciding with the cube's balanced corner. The projections of the momentum wheel center onto the X-Y plane are respectively CH1, CH2, CH3.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Control-Theory/Model.jpg" style="zoom:5%;" align=center/></p>
<p>Following equations can be derived according to the model above: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{l}
        \ s_x = s_{ch2} - (s_{ch3} + s_{ch1}) \cdot sin(30^\circ)  \\[1ex]
        \ s_y = (s_{ch3} - s_{ch1}) \cdot cos(30^\circ) \\[1ex]
        \ s_z = s_{ch1} + s_{ch2} + s_{ch3} \\[1ex]
    \end{array}
    \right.
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    \Rightarrow \quad L(qr)_n = (angle_n - angle_{ne}) \times  k_{np} + gyro_n \times k_{nv}+ s_n \times k_{ns} \ (n = x, y, z)
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>

<h2 id="regression-calculation">#Regression Calculation</h2>

        \ S_{CH1} = -L_x \cdot sin(30^\circ) - L_y \cdot cos(30^\circ) + \frac{1}{3} L_z  \\[1ex]
        \ S_{CH2} = L_x + \frac{1}{3} L_z \\[1ex]
        \ S_{CH3} = -L_x \cdot sin(30^\circ) + L_y \cdot cos(30^\circ) + \frac{1}{3} L_z \\[1ex]

    <title>Week 0: Timeline Planning &amp; Role Allocation</title>
    <url>/2024/01/27/Week-0/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Week 0 refers to the week before the start of semester 2: [01.22 - 01.28]</p>
<p>Normal Group Meeting: 01.26.2024</p>
<h2 id="timeline-planning">#Timeline Planning</h2>
<p>Although we are well aware that plans cannot always keep up with changes, an advanced plan is still necessary. In this week's team meeting, since the semester has not yet begun, we jointly drafted a complete timeline for the project from the start of the semester to the final report submission, as shown in the table below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Week-0/Timeline.jpg" style="zoom:55%;" align=center/></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="role-allocation">#Role Allocation</h2>
<p>Generally, roles were assigned according to the strengths of each member as well as our interests.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yuanpeng Li</strong>, our ‘hardware engineer’, is in charge of the soldering and the hardware analysis part. His experience, precision and attention to detail were the main reasons he got this role.</li>
<li><strong>Feijie Jia</strong> is the project manager. He meticulously planned our work with his technical insight, taking primary responsibility for overseeing the progress of the entire project. Additionally, he will participate in the learning of all theoretical knowledge sections to ensure that while the team can "divide the work," we can also "collaborate."</li>
<li><strong>Shaoxiang Wang</strong> was tasked with software development analysis. He had studied the coding fundamentals required for this project. His breakdown of the code's functional structure will make it easier for everyone to understand what the code signifies.</li>
<li><strong>Sidharth Babani</strong>, besides documenting our journey, he delved into system design and control principle. His role encompasses the theories that form the foundation of all software and hardware, intertwining with every aspect of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each member will explain the content they are responsible for during the specific weekly meetings, ensuring that the entire team has a comprehensive understanding of the project.</p>

    <title>Week 1: Order Placement &amp; PCB Soldering</title>
    <url>/2024/02/04/Week-1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Week 0 refers to the first week of semester 2: [01.29 - 02.04]</p>
<p>Normal Group Meeting: 02.03.2024</p>
<h2 id="order-placement">#Order Placement</h2>
<p>This week mainly witnessed many orders being placed and delivered. The PCB Orders are quoted from <a href="https://uk.beta-layout.com/">Beta LAYOUT</a>, and other essential chips, SMD components and peripherals are ordered through <a href="https://www.digikey.co.uk/">DigiKey</a> and <a href="https://www.lcsc.com/">LCSC Electronics</a>.</p>
<p>Here is one of the quotes once placed:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Week-1/Layout.jpg" style="zoom:65%;" align=center/></p>
<p>It must be emphasized that the quality of the PCBs are really good :)</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="pcbs-soldering">#PCBs Soldering</h2>
<p>All the PCBs are of the 0402 package type, which make it rather hard for us to soldering them. Fortunately, Feijie Jia has ordered solder paste stencil, which makes the process a little bit simplified ---- but only the other four PCBs.</p>
<p>For the 6-layer main control board, it's too complicated for us to solder them by hands, as you can see the board below: <img src="/images/Week-1/MCB.jpg" style="zoom:65%;" align=center/></p>
<p>Dr. Barry has led us to the university PCB labs for sake of any possible help, but the staff politely declined at the first glance. As a result, Feijie planned to get our PCBs populated from a factory, which should and will be done as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Our sessions were not just productive but also moments of learning. Yuanpeng Li and Feijie Jia meticulous worked on the assembly. Shaoxiang Wang and Sidharth conducted the initial software tests.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="next-week-plan">#Next Week Plan</h3>
<ul>
<li>Present a layout for poster</li>
<li>Place a surface mount technology for the MCB</li>
<li>Continuously working on the hardware and software learning parts.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="theory-study">#Theory Study</h3>
<p>This week, we primarily studied the most basic control principles of Cubli, including some mathematical modeling and analysis. For more information, please visit <a href="https://moxuef.github.io/2024/02/26/Control-Theory/">Automatic Control Principles</a>.</p>
