    <title>Week 0: Timeline Planning &amp; Role Allocation</title>
    <url>/2024/01/27/Week-0/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Week 0 refers to the week before the start of semester 2: [01.22 - 01.28]</p>
<p>Normal Group Meeting: 01.26.2024</p>
<h2 id="timeline-planning">#Timeline Planning</h2>
<p>Although we are well aware that plans cannot always keep up with changes, an advanced plan is still necessary. In this week's team meeting, since the semester has not yet begun, we jointly drafted a complete timeline for the project from the start of the semester to the final report submission, as shown in the table below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Week-0/Timeline.jpg" style="zoom:55%;" align=center/></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="role-allocation">#Role Allocation</h2>
<p>Generally, roles were assigned according to the strengths of each member as well as our interests.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yuanpeng Li</strong>, our ‘hardware engineer’, is in charge of the soldering and the hardware analysis part. His experience, precision and attention to detail were the main reasons he got this role.</li>
<li><strong>Feijie Jia</strong> is the project manager. He meticulously planned our work with his technical insight, taking primary responsibility for overseeing the progress of the entire project. Additionally, he will participate in the learning of all theoretical knowledge sections to ensure that while the team can "divide the work," we can also "collaborate."</li>
<li><strong>Shaoxiang Wang</strong> was tasked with software development analysis. He had studied the coding fundamentals required for this project. His breakdown of the code's functional structure will make it easier for everyone to understand what the code signifies.</li>
<li><strong>Sidharth Babani</strong>, besides documenting our journey, he delved into system design and control principle. His role encompasses the theories that form the foundation of all software and hardware, intertwining with every aspect of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each member will explain the content they are responsible for during the specific weekly meetings, ensuring that the entire team has a comprehensive understanding of the project.</p>
